# MiniProject-DL-Breast-cancer-detection

## Project description:

This miniproject consists in using a CNN neural net model to predict (classification) breast cancer detection on the public dataset of breast cancer available in the package datasets of scikitlearn.

## Methodologies:

 After the usual ML pipeline with a train/test split of size 20% we train a CNN neural net with a binary cross-entropy loss of  0.0496 and accuracy 0.9805 on the train set against a loss of 0.0747 and accuracy 0.9737 on the test validation set. We confront predictions with the values on the test set and visualize the plots of the loss and the accuracy metrics on the train and test sets.


## Resources and code used:
**Python version:** 3.7
**Libraries/packages used:** pandas, numpy, tensorflow, keras, scikitlearn
